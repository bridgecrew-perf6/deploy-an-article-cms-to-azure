# Article CMS Web Application deployed to Azure

In this project I built a Python article Content Management System (CMS) web application with Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. The user can log in and out and create/edit articles. An article consists of a title, author, and body of text stored in an Azure SQL Server along with an image that is stored in Azure Blob Storage. You will also implement OAuth2 with Sign in with Microsoft using the `msal` library, along with app logging.

## Application Demo
**TODO**: add a screen video of working application!

## Dependencies

1. An (free) Azure account
2. A GitHub account
3. Python 3.7 or later
4. Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (Free)
5. The latest Azure CLI (helpful; not required - all actions can be done in the portal)

You will also need to install all Python dependencies that are stored in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. 

To install them, first open a terminal window and create & activate a virtual environment: 

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies from the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Alternatively, to install them using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition:

1. In the Solution Explorer, expand "Python Environments"
2. Right click on "Python 3.7 (64-bit) (global default)" and select "Install from requirements.txt"

## Project instructions

## Creating an App Service

## Cleaning Up Your Services
Before completing this step, make sure to have taken all necessary screenshots for the project! Check the rubric in the classroom to confirm.

Clean up and remove all services, or else you will incur charges.

```bash
# replace with your resource group
RESOURCE_GROUP="<YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP>"
# run this command
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
